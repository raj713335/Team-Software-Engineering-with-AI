    "# Assignment 1 - Identifying and Fixing Bugs in Code Using an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment in the Generative AI for Software Development - Team Software Engineering course. In this assignment, you'll see several pieces of code containing bugs or issues. Your task is to identify and correct these errors. While it might be possible to debug each problem yourself, you'll find that using a large language model will help you tackle these challenges more efficiently, and might even bring up solutions you hadn't considered. This approach not only enhances your debugging skills but also introduces you to the practical applications of LLMs in software development. Get ready to sharpen your problem-solving abilities and delve into the world of code correction with an AI assistant by your side."

However, each function will contain a bug or inconsistency. Your task is to write a new function that performs the same task as the original one but with all identified bugs or issues resolved. You may ask an LLM to build unittests for you or even ask it to help you solving the exercise, it is up to you! Remember that you can also use the `unittests.py` file to debug what is going on and even using an LLM to help you in this task.\n",
